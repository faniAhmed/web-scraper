# web-scraper:
Gets image urls and downloads them.
This script gets image urls from the following site:"https://www.pexels.com/search/hd%20wallpaper/" and Downloads them. I have used selenium to automate the browser it scrolls down the page until the required number of images are not found. Images are saved with name it has on website and a file is created with urls and names of images.The site uses bot detection and doesnot allow the bot to automate. I have added neccessary features to disable bot detection
